# automotive onboard computer


Code created from scratch with my friend [Jo√£o Dourado](https://github.com/JVDourado).

The system we created consists of:

 - Turn a vehicle on and off.
 - Stop the vehicle.
 - Calculate speed.
 - Calculate distance covered.
 - Calculate fuel consumption.
 - Show battery voltage.
 - Show engine rotations per minute.
 - Show date.
 - Show the status of the vehicle's components.
 - And exit option
